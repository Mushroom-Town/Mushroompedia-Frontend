    "Description": "Agaricus arvensis, commonly known as the horse mushroom, is a sometimes massive agaric that has a white cap, ringed stem, pink or chocolate-coloured gills and no volva. It grows on soil (often heavily fertilized) or on vegetable debris.\n\nCap white or cream-coloured, may have fine scales, first hemispherical in shape before flattening out with maturity. The flesh is white, firm and thick. The cap turns yellowish where bruised, and old caps often take on a yellow-brown tinge. Gills are at first pale pink, becoming pink, then chocolate brown or blackish, free and crowded. Stem is white or cream, slightly club-shaped and smooth or finely scaly below the ring. The ring is white or cream, pendulous and superior. Viewed from below, on a closed-cap specimen, it may have a well-developed 'cogwheel' pattern around the stem. Spore print dark purple-brown.\n\nMicroscopic Features: The spores are ellipsoidal in shape, with a smooth surface and measuring approximately 6-9µm in length and 4-6µm in width.\n\nNote:The mushroom called Horse mushroom in the USA is actually the closely related Agaricus fissuratus, which from a technical, scientific standpoint is a separate species.

It grows on damp acid soil, often fruiting in small groups.\n\nCap conical to convex (partly flattening at maturity but retaining a slight or sometimes pronounced umbo). In colour, it is a tawny to date brown with paler margins and often covered in fine, fibrous scales. The margin is often slightly rolled down even in fully mature specimens. Gills initially covered by a cobweb-like veil called cortina in young specimens, start as pale yellowish and turn rusty brown as the spores mature. They have an adnate or sometimes adnexed connection to the stipe. Stem often slightly bowed rather than straight, somewhat paler than the cap and usually retains fibres from the cortina, mottled with red. The flesh is cream or pale yellow, but more tan below the pileipellis and in the stem base. Spore print rusty reddish-brown.\n\nMicroscopic Features: The spores are ellipsoidal to sub-globose in shape, measuring approximately 9-12 µm in length and 6.5-8.5 µm in width. They have a rough surface.\n\nCortinarius rubellus on the www.first-nature.com web site."

    "Description": "Lactarius turpis, also known as Ugly Milkcap, is a large, dull olive-brown agaric that is typically slimy or sticky and exudes white milk. The appearance is distinctive and the English name is very appropriate. It grows solitary or in scattered groups on soil in damp places under birch.\n\nCap margin at first involute with a somewhat depressed centre. The upper surface is olive-brown or yellow-green and is often sticky or slimy in the middle. When young it has velvety zones and may be shaggy at the rim. Later it becomes funnel-shaped and the colour darkens to blackish. Gills initially dirty white, stained olive-brown by old milk. They are fairly narrow, crowded and decurrent (extending downward). Damaged gills release plentiful white latex that dries to an olivaceous colour. Stem colour similar to that of the cap or lighter. It has a cylindrical shape that tapers towards the base, and there is no ring present on the stem. Spore print creamy white.\n\nMicroscopic Features: Spores are ellipsoidal, measuring 6.5-7.5 x 5.5-6μm. They have a textured surface with warty ridges that form a distinct network.\n\nLactarius turpis on the www.first-nature.com web site."

    "Description": "Rickenella swartzii is a tiny agaric that is pale grey to grey-brown. The cap centre (navel) is almost black while it is cream-coloured at the margin. The top of the stem is tinged dark violet. It grows in scattered trooping groups in lawns and other grasslands, typically with moss.\n\nCap initially convex and then expands to become nearly flat, occasionally having a central depression that gives it an infundibuliform (funnel-like) shape. The cap's margin is usually curved downward and is occasionally wavy. The colour of the cap is dark brown at the centre (disc) and transitions to a pale tan shade towards the margin. The flesh is cream-coloured and very thin. Gills pallid, deeply decurrent, fairly well-spaced, at first whitish, then cream-coloured. Stem rounded and mostly equal in width, with a slight enlargement at the apex. Its surface is similar to the cap, with a powdery texture (pruinose), particularly at the apex. As the mushroom ages, the stem becomes almost smooth (nearly glabrous). The colour of the stem ranges from dark vinaceous-brown to bluish-black at the apex, transitioning to a pale buff-orange shade below. There is no partial veil present. Spore print whitish.\n\nMicroscopic Features: The spores are elliptical in face-view, slightly inequilateral in profile, and measure approximately 4.0-5.5 (6) x 2.5-3.5 µm. They have a smooth surface, thin walls, granular contents, and a well-developed hilar appendage. The spores are inamyloid.\n\nRickenella swartzii on the mykoweb.com Web site."

    "Description": "Tricholomopsis rutilans, also known as Plums and Custard, is a medium to large, fleshy agaric with a cap having plum-coloured fibrils against a custard-yellow background. Its gills are egg-yellow, making it easily recognizable. This mushroom grows either solitary or in small caespitose tufts on or near rotting conifer stumps.\n\nCap starts convex with an incurved margin, turns broadly convex, bell-shaped, or nearly flat. It's dry and densely coated in red to purplish-red or brick-red fibrils. As it matures, these fibrils form small scales, exposing the yellowish base. The flesh is pallid yellow, tough, stuffed or full. Gills egg -yellow, adnexed, broad and crowded. Stem cylindrical and with a red scaly base developing to a yellow colour towards the cap. It has no ring or volva. Spore print white.\n\nMicroscopic Features: Spores are smooth, ellipsoidal to subglobose, measuring 5-7 x 3.5-5.5µm.\n\nTricholomopsis rutilans on the www.first-nature.com Web site.\n\nTricholomopsis rutilans on the MushroomExpert.Com Web site."

    "Description": "Turbinellus floccosus, also known as the Scaly Chanterelle, has an orange-capped, vase- or trumpet-shaped fruiting body. The lower surface, known as the hymenium, is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than gills or pores, and it is pale buff, yellowish, or whitish in colour. The mushroom grows mycorrhizal with conifers, including pines, spruces, firs, and hemlocks. It can be found growing alone, scattered, or gregariously.\n\nFruiting body initially cylindrical, maturing to trumpet- or vase-shaped. There is no clear demarcation between the cap and stipe. The stripe it is solid in younger specimens, though is often hollowed out by insect larvae in older ones. At higher elevations, two or three fruit bodies may arise from one stipe. Coloured with various shades of reddish- to yellowish-orange, the cap surface is broken into scales, with the spaces between more yellow and the scales themselves more orange. The white flesh is fibrous and thick, though thins with age. Somewhat brittle, it can sometimes turn brown when cut or bruised. Spore print yellowish to pale buff.\n\nMicroscopic Features: Spores measure 11–16 x 5.5–7 µm and are ellipsoid in shape, with a snout-like apical end; they have a finely verrucose surface and appear hyaline to ochraceous in potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution; they are inamyloid.\n\n\nTurbinellus floccosus on the MushroomExpert.Com web site."

    "Description": "Tylopilus felleus, commonly known as the bitter bolete or bitter tylopilus, is a type of bolete characterized by slightly to distinctly pink pores on the underside of its bun-shaped brown cap, as well as a dark net on its thick stem. It is further distinguished by its intensely bitter taste. The mushroom forms mycorrhizal relationships with coniferous trees and can be found growing individually, sparsely, or in groups in coniferous woodland environments.\n\nCap colour ranges from grey-yellow to pale or walnut-brown, starting slightly downy and later developing a smooth, matte lustre. It begins as convex and flattens with maturity. The flesh is whitish with a pinkish tinge beneath the cap cuticle, remaining unchanged; it is thick and firm. Pores initially pale cream but later turning pinkish, the tubes are round, densely packed and fairly small, terminating in palid pores spaced between 1 and 2 per mm that turn coral pink as the fruitbody matures. Stem club-shaped, ranging from whitish to pale brown above, and paler brown to tan below. It features a pronounced network pattern in brown, forming wide meshes, particularly on the upper third. The base has a white basal mycelium. It has no ring. Spore print brownish pink.\n\nMicroscopic Features: Spores are subfusiform, measuring 11-15 x 4-5μm.\n\nTylopilus felleus on the www.first-nature.com web site.\n\nTylopilus felleus on the MushroomExpert.Com Web site."
